        Alsace Class battleship

  <p>
        The Alsace class was a pair of fast battleships planned by the French Navy in the late 1930s in response to German
      plans to build two H-class battleships after the Second London Naval Treaty collapsed. The Alsace design
      was based on variants of the Richelieu class, and three proposals were submitted by the design staff.
      The proposed armament included nine or twelve 380 mm (15 in) guns or nine 406 mm (16 in) guns, but no choice was
      definitively made before the program ended in mid-1940. According to one pair of historians, logistical
      considerations—including the size of the 12-gun variant and the introduction of a new shell caliber
      for the 406 mm version—led the naval command to settle on the nine 380 mm design. But another pair of
      authors disagree, believing that the difficulty of designing and manufacturing a three-gun turret would have
      caused prohibitive delays during wartime, making the third, largest variant the most likely to have been built.
      The ships would have forced the French government to make significant improvements to its harbor and shipyard
      facilities, as the smaller Richelieus already stretched the limitations of existing shipyards. With construction
      of the first member of the class scheduled for 1941, the plan was terminated by the German victory in the
      Battle of France in May–June 1940.

      France, the United Kingdom, and the United States signed the Second London Naval Treaty in 1936,
      though Japan and Italy both refused to do so, which effectively ended the international naval arms control
      regime begun with the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. The treaty was to have reduced the caliber of new battleships'
      main batteries from 406 mm (16 in) to 356 mm (14 in) while retaining the original displacement limit of 35,000
      long tons (36,000 t), but the US Navy insisted on an "escalator clause" that allowed a reversion to 406 mm guns
      if any signatory to the original naval treaties refused to sign the Second London agreement. After Japan
      withdrew from the conference on 15 January 1937 and refused to return, the United States invoked the clause
      on 31 March. A year later, the French, American, and British naval commands exchanged notes that resulted
      in a joint agreement on 30 June 1938 permitting construction of battleships with a displacement of up to
      45,000 long tons (46,000 t).
      The French naval command initially intended to remain within the original displacement limits,
      since existing naval infrastructure prohibited vessels larger than the Richelieu class, and even for those
      35,000-ton ships, inventive measures had to be taken to build the first two vessels. The work to improve
      French shipyards and harbor facilities would have significantly increased the cost of building battleships
      up to the treaty maximum. The command assumed that only Japan and the United States would be interested in
      building 45,000-ton ships and so announced that it would respect the 35,000-ton limit so long as other European
      navies did the same. French plans were disrupted in mid-1939 when French military intelligence became aware that
      the German Kriegsmarine (War Navy) had begun construction of two H-class battleships in accordance with
      Plan Z; these were 56,000-long-ton (57,000 t) ships, though French intelligence initially believed them to
      be only 40,000-long-ton (41,000 t) vessels. This development led Vice-Amiral (Vice Admiral) François Darlan,
      the Chief of Staff of the French Navy, to order design studies for new battleships that exceeded the
      35,000-ton limit. Darlan specified that the armament was to be 400 mm (15.7 in), 406 mm, or 420 mm (16.5 in).

  <h2>
    Initial design
  </h2>
  <p>
    Design work began in late 1939; three versions were prepared, all of which were developments of the Project C type
      that was created during the design process for the Clemenceau and Gascogne variants of the Richelieu class.
      Unlike the standard Richelieu type that mounted all eight of their main battery guns in a pair of four-gun
      turrets forward, the Project C design adopted an arrangement with two three-gun turrets forward and one
      triple turret aft. The design staff considered three standard displacements; 40,000 long tons (41,000 t),
      42,500 long tons (43,200 t), and 45,000 long tons (46,000 t). The first was the same figure proposed for the
      British Lion-class battleships and that incorrectly assumed for the German H-class ships, the third was the
      maximum under the agreement reached with Britain and the United States, and the second was a compromise
      displacement figured to be the minimum that could accommodate the mandated top speed of at least
      30 knots (56 km/h; 35 mph) along with a battery of 406 mm guns.

    The first proposal for Alsace, No. 1, was essentially a slightly enlarged version of Project C.
      The ship had a longer hull, which required a 15,000 shaft horsepower (11,000 kW) increase in horsepower
      while incurring a loss of one knot in top speed. No. 2 was a scaled up version of No. 1, with the 380 mm
      guns replaced with 406 mm guns. The even larger hull necessitated a further increase in horsepower by
      20,000 shp (15,000 kW) to maintain the same speed. The No. 3 type was enlarged further to accommodate three
      quadruple 380 mm turrets, though it managed to increase speed by a knot. All of the designs would have
      carried a light anti-aircraft battery of 37 mm (1.5 in) and 25 mm (0.98 in) guns, but the numbers and
      arrangements of those guns had not been finalized before the program came to an end.
