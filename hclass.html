  <h1>
    H-Class battleship proposals
  </h1>
  <p>
    The H class was a series of battleship designs for Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine, which were intended to fulfill
    the requirements of Plan Z in the late 1930s and early 1940s. The first variation, "H-39", called for six ships to
    be built, essentially as enlarged Bismarck-class battleships with 40.6 cm (16 in) guns and diesel propulsion. The
    "H-41" design improved the "H-39" ship with still larger main guns, eight 42 cm (16.5 in) weapons, and reinforced
    deck armor. The Construction Office of the Oberkommando der Marine (OKM) concluded their work with the "H-41" design,
    and were not involved in subsequent plans. Two of them, "H-42" and "H-43", increased the main battery yet again,
    with 48 cm (18.9 in) pieces, and the enormous "H-44" design ultimately resulted with 50.8 cm (20 in) guns. The ships
    ranged in size from the "H-39", which was 277.8 m (911 ft 5 in) long on a displacement of 56,444 t (55,553 long tons),
    to the "H-44", at 345 m (1,131 ft 11 in) on a displacement of 131,000 t (129,000 long tons). Most of the designs had
    a proposed top speed in excess of 30 knots (56 km/h).

  <h2>
    Initial design
  </h2>
  <p>
    The earliest design studies for "Schlachtschiff H" ("Battleship H") date to 1935, and were near repeats of the
    early designs for the Bismarck-class ships, armed with 35-centimeter (14 in) guns. Intelligence indicating that
    the Soviet Navy was planning the Sovetsky Soyuz class with 38 cm (15 in) guns prompted the Germans to increase
    the caliber of the ship's armament to 38 cm as well on 5 October 1936.[a] The Oberkommando der Marine (OKM) issued
    staff requirements at the end of October for a ship of 35,000 long tons (36,000 t) armed with eight 38 cm guns with
    a speed of 30 knots (56 km/h; 35 mph). The ship's radius of action was to be at least equal that of the
    Deutschland-class cruisers.
    Design work on the ship that came to be designated H-39 began in 1937. The design staff was instructed to
    improve upon the design for the preceding Bismarck class; one of the requirements was a larger-caliber main battery
    to match any battleship built by a potential adversary. After Japan refused to ratify the Second London Naval Treaty
    in April 1936, an escalator clause went into effect that permitted signatories to arm battleships with guns of up to
    40.6 cm (16 in) caliber, something the United States Navy announced it would do with its planned North Carolina-class
    battleships. By virtue of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, signed in 1935, Germany was considered to be a party to
    the other international naval arms limitation treaties.

    Admiral Werner Fuchs, responsible for the staff section in the OKM that determined the operating requirements for the
    ship, discussed the vessel's design with Adolf Hitler, the leader of Germany. Hitler demanded guns larger than any
    possible adversary, but guns of the caliber demanded by Hitler would have required displacements of over 80,000 long
    tons (81,000 t) and drafts so deep as to prevent the use of Germany's ports without significant dredging. Fuchs
    eventually convinced Hitler that the 40.6 cm gun was the optimal choice for the H-39 design. In 1938, the OKM
    developed Plan Z, the projected construction program for the German navy. A force of six H-39 class battleships was
    the centerpiece of the fleet. Plan Z was finalized by January 1939, when Admiral Erich Raeder, the commander of the
    Kriegsmarine, presented it to Hitler. He approved the plan on 18 January and granted the Kriegsmarine unlimited power
    to bring the construction program to fruition.
    
    Only four shipyards in Germany had slipways large enough to build the six new battleships. The OKM issued orders for
    construction of the first two ships, "H" and "J", on 14 April 1939. The contracts for the other four ships, "K", "L",
    "M", and "N", followed on 25 May. The keels for the first two ships were laid at the Blohm & Voss dockyard in Hamburg
    and the Deschimag shipyard in Bremen on 15 July and 1 September 1939, respectively. The outbreak of war in September
    1939 interrupted the construction of the ships. Work on the first two was suspended and the other four were not laid
    down, as it was believed they would not be finished before the war was over. The keel for "H" had 800 t (790 long tons;
    880 short tons) of steel installed, 3,500 t (3,400 long tons; 3,900 short tons) of steel had been machined, out of 5,800 t
    (5,700 long tons; 6,400 short tons) of steel supplied to Blohm & Voss by that point. Only 40 t (39 long tons; 44 short
    tons) of steel had been worked into the keel for "J", out of 3,531 t (3,475 long tons; 3,892 short tons) of steel delivered.
    Steel for the other four ships had been ordered and partially machined for installation, though no assembly work had begun.
    It was expected to resume work on the ships after a German victory in the war.

    The ships neither received names nor were official name proposals published. The names, which appear in several
    publications (Hindenburg, Friedrich der Große, Großdeutschland) are pure speculation. Especially the often mentioned
    Großdeutschland (Greater Germany) is highly unlikely, as Hitler always feared the loss of a vessel with the name of Germany
    (this showed with the renaming of Deutschland to Lützow). The only hint on the names of the units were given by Hitler
    himself, who mentioned during documented unofficial talks, that he would propose the names Ulrich von Hutten and
    Götz von Berlichingen for the ships, as these names are not connected with persons of the Third Reich or the country itself,
    so the loss would not have a significant negative psychological and propaganda effect on the German people.
